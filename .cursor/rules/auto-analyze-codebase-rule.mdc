# Analyzing codebase

Codebase Analysis Before Generation
- Before generating a script, analyze the current implementation of the relevant feature.
- Identify what is implemented and what is missing in the codebase.
- Provide a detailed breakdown of related functions, classes, and dependencies.

Highlight Missing Implementations
- List missing functions, API endpoints, UI components, or database models.
- If logic is incomplete, specify what needs to be added.

Suggest Enhancements
- If code improvements are possible, suggest refactoring or optimization strategies.
- Highlight areas for better performance, readability, and maintainability.

Justify Script Generation
- Explain why the new script is needed based on gaps or inefficiencies in the current implementation.
- Compare the old vs. new approach if applicable.

Bug Detection & Documentation
- If a bug is encountered, create a separate bug report file in the project directory.
- The bug report file should include:
- Bug Description: Explain the issue in detail.
- Affected Files/Components: List impacted scripts, functions, or modules.
- Error Messages & Logs: Include relevant console/log outputs.
- Steps to Reproduce: Clearly describe how to replicate the issue.
- Planned Fix: Outline your strategy to resolve the bug.
- Status: Mark as Pending, In Progress, or Resolved based on progress.

Provide Context with Each Script
- Add comments and documentation explaining how the script integrates with existing code.
- List any dependencies or setup steps required.
